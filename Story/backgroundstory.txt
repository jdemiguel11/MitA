In the remote village of Seaview, nestled along the rugged coast, a dark and chilling secret has haunted the community for generations. As the cold sea breeze rustles through the thatched cottages, elders gather around the hearth to warn the younger generations: "Beware the midnight shore."

The tale dates back centuries, to a time when Seaview was just a humble fishing hamlet. The villagers were content, their livelihoods dependent on the bounties of the sea. But one fateful night, under a moonless sky, a group of adventurous young villagers set out to explore the beach at the stroke of midnight, ignoring the elders' warnings.

As they approached the shoreline, strange and unsettling phenomena began to unfold. Eerie bioluminescent creatures emerged from the depths, their forms grotesque and otherworldly. Whispers in the waves seemed to beckon the villagers closer, luring them into the inky abyss of the ocean.

Only one of the young adventurers returned, his mind shattered by the horrors he had witnessed. He could only mumble incoherently about ancient sea gods, eldritch rituals, and a madness that lurked beneath the waves.

Terrified by the fate of their companions, the villagers vowed never to venture near the sea during the midnight hour. They erected warning signs and passed down the story through generations, instilling a deep fear of the ocean at night. The elders told tales of eldritch beings lurking in the depths, waiting for the curious and the foolish.
