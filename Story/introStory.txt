In a world where reality blurs and sanity wanes, there exists a placeâ€”whispered only as "The Forgotten."

Nestled between ancient woods and a relentless sea, it's a village untouched by time. Few venture there, drawn by elusive riches. None return unchanged.

As an adventurer, you heed the call. Each step unveils dread and mystery. The villagers, no longer quite human, speak in cryptic verses.

A nameless cosmic entity slumbers beneath, its presence felt but unseen. The mist envelops, hiding secrets untold.

Your journey descends into the abyss. The answers await, veiled and tormenting. Will you unveil the unspeakable, or join the ranks of the forgotten?

I, now alone, stand at fate's crossroads. My destiny bound to shadows and secrets. The Village Forgotten reveals only to the daring.
