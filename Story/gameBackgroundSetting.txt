1. Protagonist and Character Development:

The main character could be an experienced adventurer, but they are lured to this village by rumors of unimaginable treasures or a personal quest.
As the game progresses, the character should undergo psychological changes due to the horrors they encounter, reflecting the Lovecraftian theme.

2. Village Setting:

The village should be isolated and shrouded in mist, making it difficult to navigate. This mist can serve as a game mechanic, limiting visibility and creating an eerie atmosphere.
Buildings in the village should be old and decrepit, with strange and unsettling symbols etched into their walls. Some buildings could be in ruins, while others may be inhabited by bizarre and hostile inhabitants.
